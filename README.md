ProjectEuler.net is a website which contains a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. This project aims to solve these challenges using algorithmic code. My native language for this is C#, followed by JavaScript. I then re-do the algorithms in languages that I am currently teaching myself - Ruby, Python and Java.If you would like more information about this repository and my contributed code, please visit the repo on GitHub.
